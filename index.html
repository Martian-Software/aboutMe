      <div class="txtBox"><p class="boxTxt">I am a web developer who loves JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I've been fluent in HTML/CSS for over 10 years.</br>
      My favorite aspect of toying with JS is generating creative and innovative solutions for problems, design goals, and overall vibe of the website/software.</p></br>
     <p class="boxTxt"> I hope that you enjoy my GitHub repositories as they are open source and are begging to be toyed around with as I did to learn, as I am 100% completely self taught.</br>
     I learned to code through the use of the console, online resources, and AI. </p></div>
